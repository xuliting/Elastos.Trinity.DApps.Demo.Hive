    <p class="ion-padding ion-text-center">
      Hive is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. 
      <br> <br>
      As opposed to a centrally located server, Hive is built around a decentralized system of user-operators 
      who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.
